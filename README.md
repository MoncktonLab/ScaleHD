ScaleHD: Automated Huntington Disease genotyping
=========================================================
ScaleHD is a package for automating the process of genotyping microsatellite repeats in Huntington Disease data.
We utilise machine learning approaches to take into account natural data 'artefacts', such as PCR slippage and somatic
mosaicism, when processing data. This provides the end-user with a simple to use platform which can robustly predict genotypes
from input data.

By default, input is an aligned .sam file (either through stdin, or user specified files/directories); only genotyping is carried out.
However, if you wish to use ScaleHD as a pipeline for unaligned reads, providing the software with a configuration XML file will allow for
quality control (trimming, demultiplexing) of raw reads, alignment, and then genotyping.

What's New
==========
Everything and nothing.
Complete re-write of previous project components.


Installation Prerequisites
==========================

Yeah, it's of no use to anyone at the moment.
This will be filled in later.
