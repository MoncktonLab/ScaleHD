Overview
================================

As mentioned in the Index of this documentation, ScaleHD is a bioinformatics pipeline for use in broad-scope automated genotyping of Huntington Disease (HD) data. The pipeline is made up of four main stages: Sequence Quality Control (SeqQC), Sequence Alignment (SeqALN) and Automated Genotyping (GType). Once a stage has completed, as per user instructions, required information is automatically passed to the next stage (..a pipeline..).

A broad overview of the pipeline stages can be viewed here:
